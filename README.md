# RaytracingRender

Todo add a decent description 

## How can I try this project

1- Clone the repo
2- run `npm install` in a command prompt in the folder
3- run `ng serve` in a command prompt. 

This will host the application on localhost:4200. You can then open that URL in your web browser, and wait for the rendering!

Currently all the rendered examples are hard-coded in, so you'd have to make modifications to the code in order to render different examples. In the future, I will add a neat interface for creating 3D objects.
